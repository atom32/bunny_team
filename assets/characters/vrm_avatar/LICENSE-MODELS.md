## Key Points

- **Contact Information**: Included in the model metadata if provided
- **Usage Rights**: Defined per model (violent usage, sexual usage, commercial usage, etc.)
- **License Type**: May vary per model (Other, CC0, CC_BY, CC_BY_NC, CC_BY_SA, CC_BY_ND, CC_BY_NC_SA, CC_BY_NC_ND, Redistribution_Prohibited)

## Checking Model License

To check the license of a VRM model:

```swift
import VRMMetalKit

let model = try await VRMModel.load(from: modelURL, device: device)
if let meta = model.vrmExtension?.meta {
    print("License: \(meta.licenseURL ?? "Not specified")")
    print("Author: \(meta.authors?.first ?? "Unknown")")
    print("Commercial use: \(meta.commercialUsage ?? "Unknown")")
}
```

## Test Models

Test VRM models included in this repository are either:

1. **Created specifically for testing** - Licensed under CC0 (public domain)
2. **Downloaded from VRM Hub** - Follow the original creator's license
3. **Generated synthetically** - Created by the VRMBuilder system, CC0 licensed
